                <li>UMRF Ventures is a company staffed by students who attend the University of Memphis. Todayâ€™s students have to successfully balance life with their school commitments. Many students take on significant debt to further their education and work multiple jobs while they go to school to meet their financial obligations. UMRF Ventures mission is to help our students succeed by providing good-paying, part-time jobs, scheduled around their classroom commitments, and conveniently located on campus.</li>
                <li>Today we have over 200 undergraduate and graduate students working at UMRF Ventures for our partner companies, who frequently hire our students as full-time employees after they graduate.</li>
